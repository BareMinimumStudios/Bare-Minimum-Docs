## Bare Minimum Studio Documentation

This repository contains the markup for our documentation hosted over at https://bareminimumstudios.github.io/Bare-Minimum-Docs 

The [theme](https://github.com/wisp-forest/docs-theme) is also included as a submodule in case you want to serve the site locally and is provided and created by the Wisp Forest Team.

### Cloning the Wisp Forest Theme

If you only want to make small modifications that do no require actually building the site, clone like normal:

`git clone https://github.com/wisp-forest/docs`

Otherwise, you'll need the theme as well. For this, clone with submodules:

`git clone https://github.com/wisp-forest/docs --recursive`
