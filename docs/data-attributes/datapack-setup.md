    This section provides an overview of the datapack structure used by Data Attributes for Minecraft 1.20.1.

- ### Structure

Data Attributes works using Minecraft’s data resource system. The file hierarchy for this is `data/namespace/attributes`. 

Where `namespace` is either the default `minecraft` or any given modid. 

By default, nothing exists in this directory, as all json data is optional. However, a fully populated directiory contains the files `entity_types.json`, `functions.json`, `properties.json` and `/overrides/` (which is a folder). 

This takes the form shown below:

```
📂data
 ┗📂<namespace>
   ┗📂attributes
     ┣📂overrides
     ┃ ┣📄attribute_name.json
     ┃ ┗...
     ┃
     ┣📄entity_types.json
     ┣📄functions.json
     ┗📄properties.json
```
